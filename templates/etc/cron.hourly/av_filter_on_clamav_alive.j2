# Goals:
#   - This script must be soft linked as 'av_filter_on_clamav_alive' in /etc/cron.hourly/
#   - The script checks if the clamav-daemon service is runnig and activate the av filtering on amavis
#   - Reloading the config of amavis & postfix when done
#   - Rrasing itself from the /etc/cron.hourly/ to avoid execution
#   - Sending a warning about clamav not started, most likely freshclam not being able to fill /var/lib/clamav with updates

# restart the clamav-daemon service to load the changes if the clamv-freshclam managed to update the database
systemctl restart clamav-daemon
sleep 5

# test if clamav-daemon is runnig already, it will run only when freshclam manages to get a full db download
R=`systemctl show -p SubState --value clamav-daemon`

    # it's alive!, doing our thing

    # configure AV filtering on amavis if not already active

    ACTIVE=`cat $FILE | grep "^#@bypass_virus_checks_maps.*"`
    if [ ! -z "$ACTIVE" ] ; then
        # not active, activating
        sed -i s/"#@bypass_virus_checks_maps"/"@bypass_virus_checks_maps"/g $FILE

        # reload services
        systemctl restart amavis
        systemctl reload postfix

        # send notice of activation
